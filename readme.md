I realized I'm noob... Just wanna implement some simple stuffs for learning purpose to my first ever Rust ðŸ¦€ project!

  - [ ] JSON RPC server : To enable user to send tx

  - [ ] Transaction Cycle
    - [ ] The sequencer and executes **validate** of sent tx, If the transaction was valid, the **execute** function is called, charges the fee : `tx.execute in blockifier`
    - [ ] If **execute** ran successfully, the sequencer includes the transaction in the block (Pending Block)
    - [ ] Close the block and save in storage ( Finalized Block )

### Learning

- `Blockifier` and `Starknet-rs` using different type. Tip for this, atm if you want to execute, you need to use `Blockifier` but except for that following `Starknet-rs` type would be much easier
